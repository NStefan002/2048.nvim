## ‚ùì How to Play

1. `:Play2048`
2. Use the `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move the squares in the desired direction.
3. Squares with the same number will merge when they collide, doubling their value.
4. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
5. Continue playing and try to achieve the highest score possible.
6. The game will automatically save your progress, so you can continue to play it whenever you want

-   `j` - move the squares down
